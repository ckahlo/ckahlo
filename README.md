### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**ckahlo/ckahlo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mobile identity / eID (BSI TR-03110 meID / IVID) and integration with Optimos 2, Fidesmo and open platforms
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to get several secure elements, eUICCs, USIMs, wearables under one hat (ideally :D)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on secure element platforms for mobile identification in open, standardized environments
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with making people understand self-sovereign decentralized secure idendity conforming to international standards
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... uh, better don't do that. May be you won't like my answer. If you don't care, give it a try.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: drop a feedback message here, on twitter, via keybase - please don't expect me to respond in realtime
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/his 
- âš¡ Fun fact: there was a discussion and a bet ~20 years ago about "internet identities" ...
